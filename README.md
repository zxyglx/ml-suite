The Xilinx ML Suite provides users the tools to develop and deploy Machine Learning applications for Real-time Inference. It provides support for many common machine learning frameworks such as Caffe, MxNet and Tensorflow as well as Python and RESTful APIs.

![](docs/tutorials/img/stack.png)

The ML Suite has three basic parts:
1. **xDNN IP** - High Performance general CNN processing engine.
2. **xfDNN Middleware** - Software Library and Tools to Interface with ML Frameworks and optimize them for Real-time Inference
3. **ML Framework and Open Source Support**  - Support for high level ML Frameworks and other open source projects
